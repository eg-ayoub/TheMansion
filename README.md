Even Games submission for ludum dare game jam august 2018

#Info
The movement mechanics in this game are inspired by our incoming game, "The Birth".
Some of the code is very unclean but that is only natural because it's a game jam submission.

# Building
All scenes must have a triad ans shaker prefab. it is only necessary to put a player in scene number 0.
Scene number 0 must always be in the build.
The rest of the prefabs are pretty self explanatory, but I may include more specifications in the future.

Have fun :).
